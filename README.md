About BMI:
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used metric to assess body weight in relation to height. It is a simple calculation that provides an indication of whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. However, please note that BMI is a general indicator and does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition.
